<h2>Executive Summary (Overview)</h2>
<h3>Haptic VR Feedback Suit</h3>

<p>Are you a gamer? Do you ever struggle with getting involved with your game? Have you ever wanted to know what it felt like to be in the game?</p> 
<p>The rise of the virtual reality market, more companies have opted to develop VR games to expand into the market.
	However, that highlights one of the most prevalent issues with VR: the lack of touch. 
	Touch is one of the most important senses to make an experience feel “real.” 
	However, unless you’re part of the world you are engaged in, you’ll never feel truly immersed into the virtual world. 
	The haptic VR Feedback suit is a responsive full-coverage suit that will provide an immersive experience through the use of user-oriented vibrations to simulate a connection to the virtual environment, providing a more immersive experience for gamers. 
	This product will resolve the disconnect between the real and virtual world by providing a simulation of touch that will truly immerse gamers in the worlds of virtual reality.</p>

<p>The Full-body VR Haptic Feedback Suit consists of a jacket, pants and a set of gloves all outfitted with haptic technology that will pair with VR technologies to provide tactile sensations from fingertip to ankle through active interaction with the game. 
	There are similar products such as the bHaptic suit. 
	However, unlike these products, which only provide sensations to regions of the body, our product will provide specific centralized vibrations to the body, providing more realistic sensations. 
	Additionally, the haptic gloves included with our product have a string that will simulate tensile resistance when interacting with the world. 
	The suit will not be able to simulate pain, the suit will have accessibility options to allow users to customize the duration and intensity of sensations.</p>

<h2>Market Research and Need Analysis</h2>

<p>Among the most crucial aspects of any modern game is immersion. 
	Though the idea of feeling truly present in a game may have been a silly concept back when games were little more than two spaceships flying around a dot, video games have now created entire worlds for players to explore. 
	And yet, these worlds have always only been one screen away. 
	Plenty of gamers are perfectly fine with this, but there are plenty of others who aren’t completely content with this gap. 
	Now with Virtual Reality, that gap has begun to close.</p>
<p>The demand for this new kind of immersion is not hard to notice. 
	Seldom a person hasn’t heard of VR, and more and more games are being adapted to it. 
	According to Fortune Business Insights, the VR gaming industry was valued at USD 25.1 billion in 2023, and it is expected to grow from 32.6 Billion in 2024 to 244.8 in 2032 with a CAGR of 28.6% [1].
<p>Several companies have provided results that go beyond impressive, the likes of which certainly never would have been thought possible in the early days of video games. 
	For instance, bHaptics suits currently have up to 40 vibrating motors and even come in one-size-fits-all [2]. 
	On the other hand, OWO suits use electrical impulses to give a greater variety of sensations to the body [3]. 
	Both of their products have been in the market for multiple years now and have achieved a good deal of success.</p>
<p>As amazing as current VR products are, however, they have their fair share of shortcomings. 
	At the moment, OWO’s haptic products only accommodate the torso area. 
	Since, of course, humans can feel contact with objects in other parts of the body, this ultimately limits immersion. 
	bHaptics products offer a fair amount more in this area, offering haptic products for the hands, forearms, and forefeet. 
	These are all separate products, however, and they do not accommodate for the full body altogether.</p>
<p>We strive to make our product surpass these limitations by making and manufacturing a full-body haptic suit. 
	This suit will encompass the whole body, allowing players to experience video gaming like they never have before. 
	Plates will be installed into far more than just the chest area, extending to the entire arms and legs. 
	For the first time in gaming history, it won’t only be the guards of <i>Skyrim</i> feeling an “arrow in the knee.”</p>

<h2>3. Product Description</h2>

<p>A haptic suit simulates touch in a virtual environment via vibrations in order to increase immersion in virtual reality. 
	Our suit would provide adequate stimulation in any area in which a player makes any form of interaction with the virtual world. 
	This could include, picking up an object in a virtual environment, touching a wall in a virtual room, or even fighting a player or npc in a game.</p>
<p>The feedback would not be able to simulate sensations such as pain or weight, therefore the immersion would stay limited. 
	Regardless, regaining a real sense of touch would help to make virtual reality feel much more real. 
	While disappointing, the feasibility of weight simulation in virtual reality is very impractical and would require a device that incorporates direct nervous system or electrical simulation which is unethical and impractical. 
	Along the same lines, pain simulation would also not be feasible. Although it would be interesting to specific markets and increase immersion immensely in certain experiences, selling a product in order to stimulate pain would run counter to many ethical standards. 
	It would also run into the same problems as weight simulation, i.e. needing a different form of haptic stimulation. 
	Therefore, these forms of stimulation will be omitted from the product.</p>
<p>The main products would consist of pants and a jacket. 
	Each part of the suit would be sold as a separate product that could connect to each other. 
	The vibrations would come from small motors implanted in small, thin plates manufactured inside of the jacket and pants. 
	The plates would be smaller than those currently on the market in order to increase the accuracy of the sensation. 
	The feedback in the vest and pants would consist of a user-decided amount vibration. 
	Depending on the user’s setting, this vibration ranges from achieving the same sensation as resting a body part on something or firmly pressing against something. 
	The product would synchronize with a software that allows users to customize their experience along with communicating with the system running the experience. Depending on interactions in the virtual world, the software would pinpoint the location on the suit and send a signal to vibrate accordingly.
<p>The secondary part of the suit would consist of a pair of gloves. The gloves would have additional features in order to also be used as a controller and provide tactile feedback. 
	They would also include a string to simulate tensile resistance when grabbing objects to further increase immersion. 
	Depending on the object being interacted with in VR, motors would increase tension to inhibit finger movement.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of our product would come from the pants and the gloves as well as the increased accuracy of the vibration. 
	While there are already solutions on the market for haptic vests, there are little to no fully realized examples of full body haptic suits and tensile restrictive gloves. 
	While these products are in development by passionate solo engineers, no company has taken on the task of manufacturing them on their own, and that is what we plan to do. 
	A full body haptic suit with gloves including haptics and resistance.</p>

<h2>4. Possible Problems and Counterarguments</h2>

<p>Potential problems on the development of a haptic bodysuit. 
	VR Haptics are slowly becoming a reality, but the application of the technology varies from game to game. 
	Our product allows for easy integration for games with the software that we are developing that provides haptic support. 
	Making integration easy would allow more VR games to utilize the features and immersion that haptic feedback suits could bring to the table.</p>
<p>Another criticism may be that through the use of vibrating plates, it is difficult to simulate pain in games. 
	We wish to prioritize the safety of the user, as inflicting real pain to the user of our product violates ethical standards. 
	However, while our product won’t simulate the pain, it will still vibrate accordingly in the area where sensation would be felt in order to give the user tactile feedback.</p>


<h2>5. Conclusion and Recommendations</h2>
<p>The [PLACEHOLDER NAME] solves a problem that many often do not think about when it comes to methods of revolutionizing and innovating within the games industry; immersion. 
	Immersion is frequently thought about in a variety of ways, typically in the sense of immersion in story-telling and visual rendering, but a mostly untapped market for furthered immersion and realism is that of haptic feedback. 
	Developers tend to spend a lot of time trying to make people feel as if they are a part of the game. 
	However, they often overlook the simplest way to achieve this.</p>
<p>Our product focuses on the simplicity of providing players the sensations of the real world in the virtual world. 
	The games market is at a low point right now, with numerous lay-offs and a lull in real innovation and advancement in the fields of hardware; the advancement of haptic feedback technology could revitalize the market by offering some of the most desired technology in history for an affordable price. 
	The power held in the sales of this product are unrivaled in recent media history.</p>
<p>The biggest selling points and benefits to the user come in the form of increased immersive storytelling and aiding in social interaction through expression and feeling. 
	Not only can the suit aid in the realism of games by letting the user feel the sensations of the world around them, like the sensation of rain on their skin in a storm or an imitation of being injured in combat (though lacking the pain), but the suit can also aid in expression between individuals in a multiplayer experience, a major boost to the immersion of a social environment where you can experience communication with others. 
	These mechanics and advancements have the potential to permanently alter the flow of the industry, and we as a team hope to further development and research into this technology to make the dream of the team behind this product a reality, that dream being a connected world with affordable and reliable haptic feedback technology.</p>
