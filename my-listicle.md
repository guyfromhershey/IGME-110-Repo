# **What I Prefer in a Game**
---
I prefer story-driven games with a good narrative. They should also have their own mechanics and quirks that make them unique.
## **Games I'm Most Inspired By:**
- [Baldur's Gate 3](https://baldursgate3.game/)
- [The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/morrowind)
- [Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain](https://www.konami.com/mg/mgsv/)
- [Octopath Traveler](https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/games/octopath-traveler)
- [Metroid Prime 3: Corruption](https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Wii/Metroid-Prime-3-Corruption-282024.html)
